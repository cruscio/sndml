<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The ServiceNow DataPump (<i>a.k.a.</i> Data Mart Loader)
is a Java application which uses ServiceNowâ€™s Web Services (SOAP) API 
to extract meta-data and data from ServiceNow.  
The Loader automatically creates tables in an SQL database 
based on meta-data extracted from ServiceNow.  
It supports a variety of load and synchronization operations including
<ul>
<li>back-loading of historical data</li>
<li><join>"refresh" which inserts/updates any records which have been inserted/updated 
in ServiceNow since the last run</join></li>
<li>"prune" which deletes any records which have been deleted in ServiceNow since the last run</li>
</ul>
